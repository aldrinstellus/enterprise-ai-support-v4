## Notes

- All patterns are case-insensitive (queries converted to lowercase in `detectWidgetQuery()`)
- Multi-step conversations use state management to track conversation context
- Button interactions are tested separately from query patterns
- Dynamic content extraction (agent names, ticket IDs, KB article numbers) is handled by regex patterns
